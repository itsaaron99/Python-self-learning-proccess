A self-learning Python guy, recording the topics that I've learned, trying to become a test engineer with below roadmap, 

Stage 1: Python Foundational Infrastructure

Skills to Learn: In-depth Lists/Dictionaries, File Handling, Error Handling.

**Practical Goal: Build a "Number Guessing Game" (with error handling & score persistence).**

Stage 2: Python Intermediate & Developer Tools

Skills to Learn:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Virtual Environments (venv) & Package Management (pip)

Git Basics (Personal Version Control & GitHub)

**Practical Goal: Set up venv, refactor the "Number Guessing Game" using OOP, and push the entire project to GitHub.**

Stage 3: Specialized Test Automation Tools

Skills to Learn: Selenium/Playwright Basics, Pytest Introduction, Pytest Fixtures.

**Practical Goal: Write your first Pytest script that can automatically open and close a browser.**

Stage 4: Practicum: Building a Maintainable Test Project

Skills to Learn: Page Object Model (POM), API Testing (requests), Test Data Management.

**Practical Goal: Use the POM pattern to build a complete UI/API automation test project.**

Milestone: You now have the core practical skills of a Junior TE. Next is the advanced path toward top-tier companies.
Stage 5: CI/CD & Automation Integration

Skills to Learn: Git for Teams (Branching & Merging), CI/CD Concepts (GitLab CI / GitHub Actions).

**Practical Goal: Set up a pipeline to automatically run your tests on every code commit.**

Stage 6: Containerization & Database Basics

Skills to Learn: Docker Core Concepts (Image, Container, Dockerfile), Database Basics (SQL Queries).

**Practical Goal: Write a Dockerfile for your test project and practice validating test results with SQL.**

Stage 7: Data Analysis & Monitoring

Skills to Learn: Python Data Libraries (Pandas), Data Visualization (Matplotlib), Dashboard Concepts.

**Practical Goal: Save test results to a file, analyze them with Pandas, and generate simple statistical charts.**
